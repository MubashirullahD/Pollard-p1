# Pollard-p1
This project was done for the subject Design Analysis of Algorithms.

## About Project
This project is about finding the two factors that went into making a public key. The algorithm can theoritically work for 10^8 integers. 
In practice, it overflows in c++ unless you do not use a big number library like MPIR.

This project should have been done in python. It would have saved us the headache of trying to set up MPIR, which did not work in the end.

Feel free to ask any questions by making an issue in the Issues tab.
